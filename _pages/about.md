I am currently working as an economist with the Oregon Department of Revenue. I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Oregon in Spring 2022. My research estimates the causal impact of national highway construction on local manufacturing and labor markets, and develops an analytical model of household labor supply. I am passionate about understanding the world around us by conceptualizing observational/experimental data using methods developed in econometrics and machine learning. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, learning new forms of art, reading philosophy and literature.
